# bologna

Bologna is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for programmatically
building educational content.



## Getting Started

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
2. Start Docker.
3. Run `docker pull seankross/bologna`
4. Run `docker run -dp 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE seankross/bologna`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:8787/ in your web browser.


## Getting Started on Digital Ocean

See all the instructions with pictures here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-docker-application

Throughout I will call the IP address `YOURIP`.

Local Machine: 

If you set this in your open terminal, the commands below should still work:

```bash
YOURIP=123.345.423.212
```

1. Make sure you use Under Choose an image, select the One-click apps tab to create a Docker image.  Don't forget to add your SSH keys.
2. Run `ssh root@${YOURIP}` in a Terminal to log into the machine.


Digital Ocean Machine in Terminal:

Here we are going to create a user other than `root`. You could use `root`, but with SSH keys on a DO instance, no password is set.  Let's make another user, for example `test`:
```
username=test
```

3. Run `docker pull seankross/bologna`
5. **CHANGE PASSWORD HERE** To start the RStudio server `docker run --name=rstudiocon -e USER=${username} -e PASSWORD=<pass word> -dp 8787:8787 seankross/bologna`.  You may also do `-e ROOT=TRUE`, but you still should have USER/PASSWORD.  
5. (optional) To access this running container in the Terminal, run `docker exec -it "rstudiocon" bash` (can also find the `ID` from `docker ps`).  Then run `su <username>` to then log into that account.

Local Machine:

1.  Then log into `YOURIP:8787` (on your local browser) using the username and password. For making multiple users, see https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Using-the-RStudio-image#multiple-users.  

- To run the container in the Terminal without mapping to the RStudio instance, run `docker run -it -e ROOT=TRUE  seankross/bologna bash`.   Now you are in the Docker image and you can run `R`.

### Copying over credentials


Local Machine:

1. Copy over credentials: `rsync ~/.aws/credentials YOUTUBE.json root@${YOURIP}`

Digital Ocean Machine in Terminal:

2. Copy YouTube credentials from DO to Docker: `docker cp YOUTUBE.json "rstudiocon":/home/${username}/YOUTUBE.json`
3. Permissions for user: `docker exec -it "rstudiocon" chown ${username} /home/${username}/YOUTUBE.json`
6. Make a `.aws` folder on Docker: 
`docker exec -it "rstudiocon" mkdir /home/${username}/.aws`
6. Copy AWS creds to Docker: `docker cp credentials "rstudiocon":/home/${username}/.aws/`
7. Permissions: `docker exec -it "rstudiocon" chown ${username} /home/${username}/.aws/credentials`
<!-- NB: `rstudio` user may be open to the whole internet if you don't use `USER` and `PASSWORD`. You can run `docker exec rstudiocon deluser rstudio` -->

### Testing

You can test if the YouTube authorization is set up:
```r
library(didactr)
yt_auth(json = "~/YOUTUBE.json") # paste in output
```

```r
library(didactr)
library(googledrive)
library(dplyr)
library(tuber)
aws.signature::use_credentials(profile = "polly")
#########################
# Find a presentation
#########################
x = drive_find(n_max = 25, type = "presentation")
```

```r
res = gs_ari(x$id[1], voice = "Joanna", 
       cleanup = FALSE,
       ffmpeg_opts = '-vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2"')
```

You can copy this and test on your local machine.

RStudio Server:
```r
file.copy(res$output, "~/output.mp4")
```

Digital Ocean:

```bash
docker cp "rstudiocon":/home/${username}/output.mp4 ~/output.mp4
```

Local Terminal:

```bash
rsync root@${YOURIP}:~/output.mp4 ./
open output.mp4
```

### Setting up some defaults

NB: `git` is already installed on the machine but not configured

1.  Either `ssh ~/.gitconfig root@${YOURIP}:~/` or set up `git config --global user.name "GITHUB_USERNAME"` and additional instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/
2.  Create a new GitHub [Personal Auth Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) that has permissions to push/pull on private repos for `CDS` so you don't need passwords for `git pull`.
NB: If you have 2-factor authentication, [you use your PAT, not your password when prompted.](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/#using-a-token-on-the-command-line)

### Google Authentication Tokens

Read https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/vignettes/managing-auth-tokens.html to talk about OAuth Tokens.

1.  Create a `googlesheets_token.rds` or the like with your authentication if necessary.
2.  OAuth is a problem for now.  Try `googlesheets::drive_auth()`. If you get `sh: 1: xdg-open: not found`, then run in `bash`: `sudo apt-get install xdg-utils --fix-missing` and rerun.  The command may now give you a link to open in your (non-DO, non-Docker) browser.  Paste the authentication code.
3. 

### Troubleshooting

1.  If you have to restart the DO droplet, run `docker container restart rstudiocon`


### A little docker commands

See https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes

1. See the volumes made `docker volume ls` if you want to stop a running image.
2. See the running containers `docker ps`.  This will show you how the are ports are mapped.  You can stop one using `docker stop <containerID>`.
2. If you are aggressive, you can try `docker system prune` for removing all stopped things.
