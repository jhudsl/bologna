# bologna

Bologna is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for programmatically
building educational content.



## Getting Started

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
2. Start Docker.
3. Run `docker pull seankross/bologna`
4. Run `docker run -dp 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE seankross/bologna`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:8787/ in your web browser.


## Getting Started on Digital Ocean

See all the instructions with pictures here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-docker-application

Throughout I will call the IP address `YOURIP`.

1. Make sure you use Under Choose an image, select the One-click apps tab to create a Docker image.  Don't forget to add your SSH keys.
2. Run `ssh root@YOURIP` in a Terminal to log into the machine.
3.  Start on `docker pull` test below.
4. Run `docker pull seankross/bologna`
5. To start the RStudio server `docker run -dp 8787:8787 -e ROOT=TRUE seankross/bologna`.  Go to `YOURIP:8787`.
6. To run on the Terminal, run `docker run -it -e ROOT=TRUE seankross/bologna bash`


Now you are in the Docker image and you can run `R`.

### Setting up some defaults

NB: `git` is already installed on the machine but not configured

1.  Either `ssh ~/.gitconfig root@YOURIP:~/` or set up `git config --global user.name "GITHUB_USERNAME"` and additional instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/
2.  Create a new GitHub [Personal Auth Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) that has permissions to push/pull on private repos for `CDS` so you don't need passwords for `git pull`.
NB: If you have 2-factor authentication, [you use your PAT, not your password when prompted.](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/#using-a-token-on-the-command-line)

### Google Authentication Tokens

Read https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/vignettes/managing-auth-tokens.html to talk about OAuth Tokens.

1.  Create a `googlesheets_token.rds` or the like with your authentication if necessary.
2.  OAuth is a problem for now.  Try `googlesheets::drive_auth()`. If you get `sh: 1: xdg-open: not found`, then run in `bash`: `sudo apt-get install xdg-utils --fix-missing` and rerun.  The command may now give you a link to open in your (non-DO, non-Docker) browser.  Paste the authentication code.
3. 


### A little docker commands

See https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes

1. See the volumes made `docker volume ls` if you want to stop a running image.
2. See the running containers `docker ps`.  This will show you how the are ports are mapped.
2. If you are aggressive, you can try `docker system prune` for removing all stopped things.
